						## Architecture Vision
						### and Development Practices
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Goals
						- Support reliability in Our Daily Bread's web infrastructure
						- Equip developers with tools and systems to achieve their teams' goals
						- Train teams to take ownership of their own application architecture
						- Build automated processes wherever possible to free up more time for development
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## QA and Testing
						Teams will decide on the exact Quality Assurance process that they will enact with their team.

						These things should be the same across teams:
						- When we write user stories, they should also have test cases
						- These test cases should be able to be performed manually or using an automated tool
						- QA and testing is the responsibility of the team as a whole, especially with the lack of dedicated QA engineers
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## QA and Testing	
						On the systems team, our focus will be empowering teams to be able to easily do tests within their software ecosystem.
					</section>


					<section data-markdown>
						### Manual vs Automated Testing
						- It will take a while for us to get used to Test Driven Development
						- Featues will take longer to accomplish
						- As we get used to it, we will get faster 
						- We will save time by have cleaner and more thought through code
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Manual vs Automated Testing
						### Why Invest in Automated Testing?
						- Humans are imperfect
						- Saves stakeholder time, because there is less manual work to be done
						- Ensures stability of system, because all tests are run when one thing changes
					</section>

						### Manual vs Automated Testing
						### Why Invest in Automated Testing?
						(old way vs new way)
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Automated Testing
						Each team will decide on what tools and practices will best fit with the platforms they are developing on.

						## Testing Decisions
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>	
						### Front end
						For front end development, we have decided to use Cypress.io, because it is able to be a single framework for end-to-end, integration, and unit tests.
						Cypress also has a dashboard that show the status of our tests, as well as generating screenshots and videos that show how the test ran.	
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>	
						### Lambda Functions

						For our Node.js Lambda functions, we will be using Mocha to do testing locally. This makes sense because Cypress uses Mocha internally.  
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>	
						### Magento
						For PHP testing, our Magento team will rely on Magento's native framework for testing, which utilizes PHPUnit.

						The Code Bread team has purchased a course on testing in Magento and will continue to develop this process.

						We would also like to rely on Cypress for testing the front end-facing parts of our Magento sites.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>	
						### WordPress

						We are still in the process of determining how to best do testing with WordPress.

						It will likely be a combination of PHPUnit and Cypress.

						We are also going to implement a CodeSniffer into our build process, so our code is statically analyzed before it deploys. This should catch a lot of syntax errors.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>	
						### Main takeaways
						The main takeaways from testing and QA is:  
						- we are going to rely more on automated processes
						- we will consider QA a team effort and part of the development process
						- we commit to use Cypress where we can, to give a great experience for developers and testers

							## Microservices
							### More than just a buzz word
						</section>

						<section data-markdown>	
							### Definition of Micro Service
							A loosely couple service that has its own data model and can interact with other services via an API.
						</section>

						<section data-markdown>	
							A primary goal of our systems team will be to build a path for replacing our WordPress sites with a micro service architecture.

							This will allow us to:
								- have improved performance by designing our APIs around *our* data
								- develop more rapidly, because we don't have to worry about what our changes will do to other parts of the application
								- reduce costs significantly by utilizing Amazon's pay-per-use pricing model.
						</section>

						<section data-markdown>	
							The ODBx project has gotten us started down the road of using microservices. The drag-and-drop content on the home page is all served using a micro service API.

							For this project, we were learning as we went.

							Our goal on the systems team is to build those services into a version control repository, and apply DevOps practices to development of these services.
						</section>

						<section data-markdown>	
							### DevOps with Microservices
							We have a single project (tentativley named "crouton"), that stores all the code of our different microservices.
							
							We've worked with David Tucker to build a CI/CD system, where pushing to this repository will automatically deploy these changes to our APIs.

							We're relying on the Serverless Framework to build the infrastructure for our services, using templates.
						</section>

						<section data-markdown>	
							### Microservices Goals
							- Update our ODBx services to use the Serverless framework within the Crouton project
							- Improve our DevOps practices with automated test, better deployment, and A/B Testing
							- Teach our teams how to use the Serverless framework to build microservices for their future development

							The main takeaway is that any new API development should be built using our Serverless tools.

						### What have we been doing lately

						Here are some things that we're doing architecturally to improve our systems:

						- Switch our WordPress instance type to the t3 family to use CPU bursting when we hit peak traffic 
						- Switched all WordPress sits into our PCI Compliant environment, for better security
						- Are working on optimizing images in S3 buckets for faster load times, lower costs
						- Using Elastic File System to store our configuration files across servers
						- Added Status Cake to all of our sites to notify us via Slack and email in case of downtime
						- Hired a new developer to work with our infrastructure!
