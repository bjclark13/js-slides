						## Architecture Vision
						### and Development Practices
						#### (take 3)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Bakers Team Goals
						- Support reliability in Our Daily Bread's software infrastructure
						- Equip developers with tools and systems to achieve their teams' goals
						- Train teams to take ownership of their own application architecture
						- Build automated processes wherever possible to free up more time for development
					</section>

						## QA and Testing

						### QA and Testing

						Last PI, we had a focus on writing automated tests for features we are working on.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### QA and Testing

						Two main categories of tests include:
						1. Tests that run during the build on Pull Requests
							- Here we launch a local version of the application and run tests against that.
						2. Tests that run against code already in production
							- Good for making sure tests are still passing, even when code doesn't change.
							- Can be used for regression testing.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### QA and Testing

						For the second example, we have a repo that holds all end-to-end tests and compiles them into a single report.

						- https://github.com/rbcministries/cypress-e2e
						- http://odbtests.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/reports.html

					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### QA and Testing

						This can be used for devs and non-devs alike to verify whether tests our sites and services are stable and behaving as expected.

						For example, design can go to this page and verify whether our site is meeting basic accessibility standards.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Testing for Accessibility on the Web
						Accessibility is incredibly important to ODB (it's in our mission)

						There are a lot of great tools for testing our code for accessibility:
										</section>


					<section data-markdown>
						### Testing for Accessibility on the Web

						1. Cypress (https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-axe#output--Cypress) can evaluate any DOM element or page for accessibility. Example: https://github.com/rbcministries/cypress-e2e/blob/master/odb-experience/tests/integration/accessibility.spec.js
						2. Lighthouse (open Chrome Dev Tools)
						3. ESLint (https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)

					</section>

						### Testing for Accessibility on the Web

						None of these tools are perfect, but can help us catch low-hanging fruit.

						## Non Functional Requirements
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### What are NFRs

						These are requirements that every system we build should adhere to, even though the end-user doesn't necessarily see the results.

						They are to ensure quality, stability, security, and reliability.
					</section>


					<section data-markdown>
						#### Here are some basic NFRs starting this Program Increment

						- Front end initial response time should be less than 3 seconds
						- API/Servers should be able to automatically and manually scale to match load
						- Logs should be rotated regularly on servers, or set to expire in CloudWatch
					</section>

                    <section data-markdown>
						*(continued)*

						- If running server is terminated/fails, site should be able to recover on its own
						- Lambda functions should use version control and Serverless Framework, CloudFormation, or similar tool
						- Configurations & changes should always be baked into a deployment, i.e. if a new server spins up, it should have the same configuration

					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						*(continued continued)*

						- Each ticket should evaluated if automated tests should be written.
						- Automated tests should be run locally and pass before being merged.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Additions

						- *If an item that does falls under LOAF does not use the LOAF stylesheet or component, then a ticket should be created to migrate it.*
						- *Any hard-coded text should be localized, i.e., wrapped in a translation function or component*
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						These additions are valubable, because they:
						- Ensure that adding support to new languages is seamless
						- Help us gauge what work needs to be done to reduce technical debt by refactoring to LOAF.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						We are adding these in the form of checkboxes to our pull requests to ensure that in code review, we are testing agains NFRs

						Example: https://github.com/rbcministries/ODB-Experience
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						The goals is not necessarily to enforce testing on every PR, but to hold each other accountable to writing tests, and have a conversation about the best way to write tests.

                        ### Review: Eliminating Toil

                        - Toil is a term coined by Google's reliability team
                        - Toil is essentially work that is manual and should be automated.
                        - Not administrative work, like team meetings
                        - https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						### Review: Eliminating Toil

						- What's an example of where we elimated toil in this last PI?
						- What's an example of an opportunity to eliminate toil going forward?
                    </section>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <section data-markdown>
						### Architectural Goals Summary

						- Ensure NFRs are visible and being evaluated on every ticket
						- Help continue to make testing and automation easier for each team

						#### If there are any specific ways that we can help achieve these, please send us a message, or create a ticket in our backlog.
