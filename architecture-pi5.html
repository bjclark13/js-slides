					### Bakers Team Goals
					- Support reliability in Our Daily Bread's software infrastructure
					- Equip developers with tools and systems to achieve their teams' goals
					- Train teams to take ownership of their own application architecture
					- Build automated processes wherever possible to free up more time for development

					## Testing
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Testing

					- We have done a great job of starting to implement automated testing in our processes
					- We have reported 40% code coverage already!
					- We know that we have had frustrations will failing tests
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Why Do Tests Fail?

					<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/lD76yTC5zxZPG/200w_d.gif" />

					Tests fail from two main reasons:

					1. Our code does not work well
					2. The test does not work well
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### When code does not work well

					When our code does not work well, we simply need to fix it.

					This is the purpose of testing. We should not be releasing features when the tests tell us our code
					is not working
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### When the test does not work well

					Tests are code too, so this means that sometimes we write poor tests. When this happens we can
					either:
					1. Fix the tests right away
					2. Skip the test (by adding .skip around your spec) and create a bug ticket for *fixing the test
					functionality*


				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### When the test does not work well

					Option number two allows you to not disrupt your development (people > process), but also not ignore
					the problem.

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### When the test does not work well

					If the test that is failing is for the feature you are currently working on, you should always do
					option number one.

					### Common Cypress Mistakes
					- Using async/await
					- Using the UI to log in
					- Relying on test data that is bound to change
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Common Cypress Fixes
					- Using async/await *Don't*
					- Using the UI to log in *Use cy.login instead*
					- Relying on test data that is bound to change *Use mocking and stubbing, shallow render, and/or
					right unit tests instead.*

					## Security

				<section data-markdown>
					### Security

					- Thank you for not killing us after we started implementing MFA
					- Security is very important to protect our users and our organization
					- The Bakers team will focus on analyzing and remediating security issues in our systems
					- The following NFR has been added:
					*Admin API requests need to use an authorizer to prevent access
					to end users (not just hiding the admin screen)*

				<section data-markdown>
					### The Future of Our Architecture

					We have a few goals for our architecture that we believe will help us achieve the organizational
					mission and vision.

					These include:
					- Migration Away From WordPress In Favor of Crouton
					- Collecting and Analyzing Big Data (we need to start collecting more data)
					- Utilizing ElasticSearch technology for admins and users

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### How Will We Achieve This?

					- Migration Away From WordPress In Favor of Crouton
					*Don't create anything new in WordPress for daily devos.*

					- Collecting and Analyzing Big Data
					*Start collecting data and feedback (without violating user privacy)*

					- Utilizing ElasticSearch technology for admins and users
					*Bakers will have objective for implementing elastic search for post by scripture reference (as
					prototype)*

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### How Will We Achieve This?

					- Migration Away From WordPress In Favor of Crouton

					*Don't create anything new in WordPress for daily devos sites. Develop microservices and React
					components instead*

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### How Will We Achieve This?

					- Collecting and Analyzing Big Data

					*Start collecting data and feedback (without violating user privacy)*

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### How Will We Achieve This?

					We will be working to help align both business and architectural goals in future features.
