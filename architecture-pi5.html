						## Non Functional Requirements (NFRs)
                    </section>


					<section data-markdown>
                        ### NFRs

                        We have updated the NFRs to be more generic, i.e., not specific to a certain platform.

                        This will help us keep the NFRs the same no matter where our technology goes.

                        NFRs are in [Confluence](https://ourdailybread.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OPHP/pages/71893012/Non-Functional+Requirements)
                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### NFRs in Practice

                        NFRs are not necessarily acceptance criteria, because they are used to describe non-functional attributes of all our systems.

                        However, if it is useful to ensure we are accomplishing NFRs, any NFR may be added to either acceptance criteria of a user story, or as part of the team's Definition of Done.

                        ### Back To Testing

                        - We have done a great job of starting to implement automated testing in our processes
                        - Now we are going to start tracking metrics on testing.
                        - The Bakers team will be evaluating code coverage tools for each of our platforms.

                        ### Back To Testing

                        - We would also like to begin doing UI tests on mobile apps
                        - The manual QA before an app release is an arduous process
                        - The technology used for this is yet to be determined.

                        ### Security

                        - Security is important for any organization
                        - We need to ensure that we are protecting the ministry, as well as customer data
                        - While we do our best to implement best security practices, we can always do better
                        - One of the Bakers team objectives will be to get training in security, and implement any need changes.

                        ### Architectural Goals Summary

                        - NFRs will be less platform-specific
                        - We will begin tracking code coverage on our applications
                        - We will receive training and implement best security standards

                        *If there are any specific ways that we can help achieve these, please send us a message, or create a ticket in our backlog.*
