						### Systems Team Goals
						- Support reliability in Our Daily Bread's software infrastructure
						- Equip developers with tools and systems to achieve their teams' goals
						- Train teams to take ownership of their own application architecture
						- Build automated processes wherever possible to free up more time for development

                        ### QA and Testing

                        Over the last PI, we decided to use Cypress for front end testing, and use PHPUnit for Unit testing in our PHP applicaitons.

                        We set up automated process to ensure that tests pass before a build runs.

                        ### QA and Testing

                        Going forward, we will to grow our testing chops.

                        Instead of the goal of writing 1 unit tests, this increment, I'd like us to write tests whenever the ticket calls for it.

                        ### QA and Testing

                        Any work being done should have an answer to this question "*Do I need to write tests for this?*". This takes practice, and thought into whether the cost of writing tests is justified by increased reliablility.

                        If we are writing tests, we should write the tests *first*, then write the code to make the tests pass.

					<section data-markdown>
						### What are NFRs

						These are requirements that every system we build should adhere to, even though the end-user doesn't necessarily see the results.

						They are to ensure quality, stability, security, and reliability.
					</section>


					<section data-markdown>
						#### Here are some basic NFRs starting this Program Increment

						- Front end initial response time should be less than 3 seconds
						- API/Servers should be able to automatically and manually scale to match load
						- Logs should be rotated regularly on servers, or set to expire in CloudWatch

					</section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        *(continued)*
                        - If running server is terminated/fails, site should be able to recover on its own
                        - Lambda functions should use version control and Serverless Framework, CloudFormation, or similar tool
                        - Configurations & changes should always be baked into a deployment, i.e. if a new server spins up, it should have the same configuration
                    </section>

                            ### Additions
                            - *Each ticket should evaluated if automated tests should be written.*
                            - *Automated tests should be run locally and pass before being merged.*

                    ### Microservices Recap
                    - Since last PI Planning, we have built many new microservices, including:
                        - Journals
                        - Comments
                        - Bookmarks
                        - ODBx Widgets
                        - Translation Engine

                        ### Eliminating Toil

                        - Toil is a term coined by Google's reliability team
                        - Toil is essentially work that is manual and should be automated.
                        - Not administrative work, like team meetings
                        - https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/
                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Some Examples of Toil at ODB
                        - Manually compiling translations
                        - Manually generated emails
                        - Scaling servers by hand
                    </section>

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### When Should I Fix Toil
                        - If you are building a feature that touches something that includes toil, it is your responsibility to address it.
                        - Either make the change immediately, or create a new enabler ticket to address the problem.

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Tools for Reducing Toil
                        - For repetitive work, consider using Cloudwatch events to trigger scripts on a cycle
                            - Similar solution to using crontab on a server.
                        - Bash scripts are incredibly helpful to write small, automated tasks.
                        - Utilize Gulp, a JavaScript tool for automated tasks
                            - Can use `watch`ing to run tasks whenever you make a change to a file
                            - Get add Gulp or similar to build process, to run before you deploy need code.

                        ### Architectural Goals Summary

                        - Identify and reduce toil using automation
                        - Ensure NFRs are visible and being evaluated on every ticket
                        - Ensure automated tests are easy to create and is implemented into the development process
